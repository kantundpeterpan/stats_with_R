# Data

## Intro

The General Social Survey is a US-nationwide sociological survey, nowadays conducted biannually since 1972 to "gather data to monitor and explain trends, changes, and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes as well as examine the structure, development, and functioning of society in general as well as the role of various sub-groups." ([ref. GSS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Social_Survey)).

## Sampling strategy and generalizability of findings

The sample population includes English-speaking (and since 2006, Spanish speaking) Americans over 18 living in "non-institutional arrangements" (excluding people living in college dorms, military quarters, nursing homes and long-term care facilities) within the US ([GSS Introduction](http://www.gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_intro.pdf), p. 8).

Parts of the surveys of 1972-1974 and parts of the 1975 and 1976 surveys used block quota sampling, while all remaining surveys employed full probability sampling (GSS Introduction, p. 8; For detailed Sampling Design see [Appendix A](http://www.gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA.pdf)).

In quota sampling, a number of subjects with a certain characteristic which is to be sampled is defined beforehand. Sampling continues until the quota is fulfilled. It is a non-probabiblistic sampling strategy, therefore the results are not generalizable to the population at large.

In contrast, the data acquired with full probability sampling can be generalized from the sample to the population from which the sample was taken (1978 - today).

### Convenience bias

A putative bias in surveys is sampling only subjects that can easily be reached, which in this sampling framework means e.g. people being at home. Measures have been taken to reduce this bias as described in ([Appendix A](http://www.gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA.pdf), p. 2).

### Non-responder bias

If too many people do not respond to a survey, its generalizability might be limited (OpenIntro Statistics, p. 24). In the GSS, temporary non-respondents are sub-sampled and the cases in this sample where then pursued further to ensure a representative sample ([Appendix A](http://www.gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA.pdf), p. 19 ff.)

### Age bias

As pointed out above, included subjects are older than 18. In addition, the condition to live in a household excludes a substantial part of those 18-24 (9.4% in 1980) and of those 75 and older (11.4% in 1980), see [Appendix A](http://www.gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA.pdf), p. 1.

Taken together, conclusions from this data are not applicable neither to children nor teenagers, while they can be generalized to the sampled population, if interpreted carefully for the age groups 18-24 and \>75, as these results may be skewed.

### Causality

The GSS is an observational study (no random assignment) and therefore does not allow for any causal conclusions on any observed associations between variables.

# Research question

Has the proportions of women keeping the house significantly changed between 1980 and 2010?

Gender equality is one of the important discussions of our time, a major demand of women during the last decades was unhindered access to the labor market, therefore it is of interest to investigate whether less (or more) women are staying at home to keep the house.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exploratory data analysis

## Workstatus over time

``` {.sourceCode .r}
df = select(gss, year, sex, wrkstat) %>% 
      na.omit()  %>% group_by(year,sex) %>% 
      count(wrkstat) %>% mutate(p=100*n/sum(n))
```

``` {.sourceCode .r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=p, fill=wrkstat)) + 
    geom_area() + facet_grid(~sex) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 50, alpha=0.5, linetype='dashed') +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 25, alpha=0.5, linetype='dashed') +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 75, alpha=0.5, linetype='dashed') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1980, alpha = 0.5, linetype='dashed') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 2010, alpha = 0.5, linetype='dashed')
```

The plot shows the distribution of the workstatus over time conditioned by gender. Changes for men seem to be less dynamic than for women over this period of time.

``` {.sourceCode .r}
df %>% na.omit() %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female" & wrkstat == "Keeping House" & (year==1980 | year==2010)) %>%
  summarise(n = n,p=round(p,2))
```

```         
## # A tibble: 2 x 4
## # Groups:   year [2]
##    year sex        n     p
##   <int> <fct>  <int> <dbl>
## 1  1980 Female   349  42.2
## 2  2010 Female   204  17.7
```

**Table 1** shows the proportions of women which named "Keeping House" as their workstatus in the samples of 1980 and 2010, respectively. There is an observeddifference of -24.48 %.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Inference

## Hypotheses

We need to state two hypotheses $H_0$ (null hypothesis) and $H_1$ (alternative hypothesis). The null hypothesis states that the data do not provide convincing evidence that there is a significant difference between the samples with respect to the chosen test statistic. $H_0$ instead states that there is convincing evidence for a significant difference. An important principle in inferential statistcs is to assume the null hypothesis to be true, until finding evidence (e.g. using an hypothesis test) that it is not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applied within the framework of the research question, $H_0$ would be :

There is no significant difference between the proportion of women keeping the house in the 1980 and 2010 samples. Any observed difference is likely due to chance.

$H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$H_1$:

The data provide convincing evidence, that proportions of women keeping the house in the 1980 and 2010 samples are significantly differnt. The observed difference is very unlikely to be due to chance.

$H_1: p_1 - p_2 \neq 0$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As can be seen in the equations for $H_0$ and $H_1$, the parameter of interest in this case is the difference of the proportions of women keeping the house in the 1980 and 2010 samples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variable preparation

To facilitate hypothesis testing and to be able to construct a confidence interval, the variable `wrkstat` with originally 8 levels will be transformed to a new variable `at_home` with two levels.

``` {.sourceCode .r}
test <- select(gss, year, sex, wrkstat) %>% #select all important variables
  na.omit() %>%
  filter((year == 1980 | year == 2010) & sex == "Female") %>% #filter for female participants in 2010 and 1980
  mutate(at_home=wrkstat=="Keeping House",
         year=as.factor(year))
```

## Confidence Interval

### Method description

In contrast to a point estimate of a statistic (mean, median, sample proportion), a confidence interval proposes a range of plausible values for the chosen statistic for a chosen confidence level ($1 - \alpha$)

The generic formula for a confidence interval:

$CI_{1-\alpha} = \left[point\ estimate \pm z \times SE\right]$

has to be adapted for the parameter of interest (difference of two proportions) and the chosen confidence level ($95\%$):

$\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2} \pm z \times \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} +
\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$

The formula for the standard error is based on the normal approximation and holds true, only if the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) can be invoked. Therefore certain conditions have to be checked, see below (conditions satisfied for construction of a confidence interval).

### Conditions Check

**Independence** As for each turn of the GSS a new random sample is created, the observations for 1980 and 2010 can be assumed to be independent.

**Success-Failure-Condition**

``` {.sourceCode .r}
test %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(at_home) %>% 
  mutate(p=round(n/sum(n),2)) %>%
  kable()
```

| year | at_home |   n |    p |
|:-----|:--------|----:|-----:|
| 1980 | FALSE   | 478 | 0.58 |
| 1980 | TRUE    | 349 | 0.42 |
| 2010 | FALSE   | 947 | 0.82 |
| 2010 | TRUE    | 204 | 0.18 |

The success-failure-condition requires at least 10 successes and at least 10 failures for each group in order to construct a confidence interval a confidence interval based on the CLT. As can be seen from columns *n* of the table above, this conditions is satified.

### Calculations

``` {.sourceCode .r}
inference(y = at_home, 
          x = year, 
          data = test, 
          statistic = "proportion", 
          type = "ci", 
          alternative='twosided', 
          method = "theoretical", 
          success = TRUE)
```

```         
## Response variable: categorical (2 levels, success: TRUE)
## Explanatory variable: categorical (2 levels) 
## n_1980 = 827, p_hat_1980 = 0.422
## n_2010 = 1151, p_hat_2010 = 0.1772
## 95% CI (1980 - 2010): (0.2045 , 0.285)
```

### Interpretation

The plot gives the distribution of women keeping the house in the 1980 and 2010 samples. The text output gives a 95% confidence interval for difference on the two proportions from 20.45% - 28.50%. This interval has a 95% probability of containing the true population parameter. Note that the interval does not include zero, which indicates, that the two proportions are indeed significantly different.

### Hypothesis test

#### Method description

A hypothesis test for a difference of two proportions based on the CLT constructs the distribution of this difference under the assumptions that the null hypothesis is true. It then gives the probability of finding an equal or more extreme outcome with respect to the difference observed form the two samples. This probability is also called *p-value*. If the *p-value* is smaller than some chosen significance level (very often 5%), we can conclude that the data provides convincing evidence for rejection of the null hypothesis. We instead accept the alternative hypothesis.

#### Conditions Check

As for the construction of a condifidence interval, certain conditions have to be met in order to perform a hypothesis test on the difference of two proportions.

**Independence** As for each turn of the GSS a new random sample is created, the observations for 1980 and 2010 can be assumed to be independent.

**Success-Failure-Condition** Checking the success-failure-condition for a hypothesis test on the difference of two proportions is slightly different compared to constructing a confidence interval. Instead of checking it invidually for both samples with $\hat{p_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}$ as estimates for the population proportions, we will use the pooled proportion

$$\hat{p}_{pooled} = \frac{\hat{p_1}n_1+\hat{p_2}n_2}{n_1+n_2}$$

for checking the success-failure-condition and to calculate the standard error. This provides the best estimate for the proportion of successes assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

``` {.sourceCode .r}
test %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(at_home) %>% 
  mutate(p=round(n/sum(n),2)) %>%
  kable()
```

| year | at_home |   n |    p |
|:-----|:--------|----:|-----:|
| 1980 | FALSE   | 478 | 0.58 |
| 1980 | TRUE    | 349 | 0.42 |
| 2010 | FALSE   | 947 | 0.82 |
| 2010 | TRUE    | 204 | 0.18 |

In our case:

$\hat{p}_{pooled} = \frac{(349+204)}{349+478+204+947} = 0.2796$

**1980**

$\hat{p}_{pooled} \times n_{success} = 0.2796 \times 349 = 97$

$(1-\hat{p}_{pooled}) \times n_{failure} = 0.7204 \times 478 =
344$

**2010**

$\hat{p}_{pooled} \times n_{success} = 0.2796 \times 204 = 57$

$(1-\hat{p}_{pooled}) \times n_{failure} = 0.7204 \times 947 =
682$

The success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10.

#### Calculations

``` {.sourceCode .r}
inference(y = at_home, 
          x = year, 
          data = test, 
          statistic = "proportion", 
          type = "ht", 
          alternative='twosided', 
          method = "theoretical",
          null = 0,
          success = TRUE)
```

```         
## Response variable: categorical (2 levels, success: TRUE)
## Explanatory variable: categorical (2 levels) 
## n_1980 = 827, p_hat_1980 = 0.422
## n_2010 = 1151, p_hat_2010 = 0.1772
## H0: p_1980 =  p_2010
## HA: p_1980 != p_2010
## z = 11.9644
## p_value = < 0.0001
```

#### Interpretation

The plots give the distribution of women keeping the house in the 1980 and 2010 samples and the distribution for the difference of the two proportions under the null hypothesis. The red line indicates the observed difference, the area under the curve in the red shaded areas give the probability of finding an equal or more extreme outcome (= *p-value*). Obviously, this area is very small. This is reflected in the text output which gives *p-value \< 0.0001*, we therefore can reject the null hypothesis: the data provide convincing evidence that the observed difference in the proportion of women keeping the house in 1980 and 2010 is statistically significant at the 5% significance level.

### Conclusion

Both methods for inference on the difference of the proportions of women keeping the house in 1980 and 2010 agree. The 95% CI does not include zero, the *p-value* returned by the hypothesis test allows for rejection of the null hypothesis. We can therefore conclude that the data provides convincing evidence that the observed difference of -24.48% is not due to chance (at the 5% significance level).
